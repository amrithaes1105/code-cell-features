# Code Cell Features

## Overview
Code cells are interactive components used in notebooks and development environments
to write, execute, and test code efficiently. They support rapid experimentation and
incremental development.

---

## Key Features

### 1. Code Execution
- Execute code directly within the cell
- Run cells individually or sequentially
- Supports multiple programming languages (commonly Python)

### 2. Interactive Output
- Displays output immediately after execution
- Supports text, tables, plots, and visualizations
- Shows error messages and stack traces for debugging

### 3. Incremental Development
- Modify and re-run code without restarting the entire program
- Helps in testing small code blocks quickly
- Encourages exploratory programming

### 4. State Persistence
- Variables and objects persist across cells
- Enables reuse of data and functions
- Allows step-by-step workflow execution

### 5. Debugging Support
- Immediate feedback on syntax and runtime errors
- Easy to isolate and fix issues
- Supports print statements and logging

### 6. Integration with Libraries
- Compatible with data science and ML libraries
- Works well with NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, TensorFlow, etc.
- Enables real-time data analysis and visualization

---

## Advantages
- Improves productivity
- Enhances readability of code and results
- Ideal for learning, research, and prototyping

---

## Conclusion
Code cells provide a flexible and interactive coding experience, making them an
essential feature in notebook-based development environments.
